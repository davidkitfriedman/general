### No, but I'm seeking to determine notability for Wikipedia inclusion purposes of a particular consortium.

Got it! For a consortium to be considered notable for a Wikipedia article, it generally needs to meet the following criteria:

1. **Significant Coverage**: The consortium should have received significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28organizations_and_companies%29). This means that the consortium has been mentioned in detail by sources that are not affiliated with it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28organizations_and_companies%29).
2. **Independent Verification**: The information about the consortium must be verifiable and come from independent, third-party sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28organizations_and_companies%29).
3. **Notability**: The consortium should be notable enough to be considered "worthy of notice". This doesn't necessarily mean it has to be famous, but it should have a clear impact or significance in its field.

If you can provide evidence that the consortium meets these criteria, it stands a good chance of being considered notable for a Wikipedia article. Do you have a specific consortium in mind that you're researching?

### Yes, the name of the consortium is Global Platform.

The **GlobalPlatform** consortium focuses on developing and promoting secure specifications and standards for digital services and devices. It's particularly known for its work in the areas of **Internet of Things (IoT)** security, **digital identity**, and **secure elements**.

Given its significant role in IoT security and its recognition by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN and CENELEC), it seems like it could meet the criteria for notability on Wikipedia. However, you'll need to ensure there are reliable, independent sources that provide detailed coverage of the consortium's activities and impact.

### Can I share this chat with other Wikipedia editors ?

Feel free to share any information or insights from our conversation with other Wikipedia editors. However, keep in mind that it's always a good idea to verify the information with reliable sources to ensure accuracy. If you need more detailed references or additional help, let me know!

### okay, so an above previous response mentioned that it could meet the criteria for notability. On the other hand, it's been deleted and deemed not notable by a number of Wikipedia editors. It's not clear what would persuade people that it's notable.

I understand the challenge. It can be tricky to convince Wikipedia editors of a topic's notability, especially if it's been previously rejected. Here are a few strategies that might help:

Gather More Sources: Ensure you have a robust collection of reliable, independent sources that provide significant coverage of the consortium. Look for articles in well-regarded publications, industry reports, and reputable news outlets.

Highlight Impact and Importance: Emphasize the consortium's impact on its field, its contributions to technology or industry standards, and any significant achievements or milestones. This can help demonstrate its importance and relevance.

Compare with Similar Topics: Find examples of similar consortia or organizations that have Wikipedia articles and compare their coverage and sources with those of GlobalPlatform. This can help establish a benchmark for notability.

Engage with the Community: Participate in relevant Wikipedia talk pages and forums to discuss the consortium's notability with other editors. Explain why you believe it meets the criteria and address any concerns they might have.

Provide Clear Context: Make sure the article provides clear context about the consortium's purpose, activities, and significance. This can help readers understand why it's notable.

### Would it be possible to make a more specific argument against notability, which is specific to this consortium along with the available sources or lack of available sources?

Absolutely! Here's a more specific argument against the notability of the GlobalPlatform consortium, considering the available sources:

Limited Independent Coverage: While GlobalPlatform has been mentioned in some industry reports and technical documents, there is a lack of significant coverage in well-regarded, independent news outlets or publications. Most of the available sources are either directly affiliated with the consortium or are technical documents that don't provide the depth of coverage required by Wikipedia.

Niche Impact: Although GlobalPlatform plays a role in IoT security and digital identity, its impact is relatively niche compared to broader, more widely recognized organizations. The consortium's work, while important within its field, may not be seen as having a substantial impact on a global scale.

Comparison with Similar Consortia: When compared to other consortia with Wikipedia articles, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) or the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), GlobalPlatform's coverage and recognition seem less extensive. These organizations have a more significant presence in the media and academic literature.

Community Consensus: Given that multiple Wikipedia editors have previously deemed GlobalPlatform not notable, there is a strong community consensus against its inclusion. Overturning this consensus would require compelling new evidence that clearly demonstrates its significance and impact.

Lack of Clear Context: The available sources often focus on technical aspects and industry-specific details without providing a broader context about the consortium's purpose, activities, and significance. This makes it harder for readers to understand why GlobalPlatform is notable.

### On the other hand, would it be possible to make a more specific argument for notability and inclusion?

Certainly! Here's a more specific argument for the notability and inclusion of the GlobalPlatform consortium:

Significant Coverage in Industry Publications: GlobalPlatform has been covered extensively in various industry-specific publications, such as security journals, IoT magazines, and digital identity reports. These sources highlight the consortium's contributions to setting standards and ensuring security in emerging technologies.

Recognition by Standardization Bodies: GlobalPlatform's specifications and standards have been recognized and adopted by major standardization bodies such as the European Committee for Standardization (CEN and CENELEC). This recognition demonstrates the consortium's impact and authority in the field of security standards.

Broad Industry Adoption: The consortium's specifications are widely adopted by key players in the industry, including major technology companies and device manufacturers. This widespread adoption showcases the practical significance and influence of GlobalPlatform's work.

Collaborations and Partnerships: GlobalPlatform collaborates with other notable organizations and consortia in the technology sector, enhancing its visibility and credibility. These collaborations often result in joint initiatives and publications, further establishing its relevance.

Impact on IoT Security and Digital Identity: GlobalPlatform has played a critical role in advancing IoT security and digital identity solutions. Its contributions in these areas have been essential in addressing the security challenges posed by the rapid growth of connected devices.

To strengthen your case, consider gathering and presenting detailed sources that provide significant coverage of these aspects. Highlighting specific examples, such as adoption by well-known companies and recognition by standardization bodies, can help make a compelling argument for GlobalPlatform's notability.
